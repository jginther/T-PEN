TPEN is open source software, made available under the Educational Community License, Version 2.0. You can install your own instance of TPEN, or just look at the source code to see how things work. Note that you may use TPEN at t-pen.org for free any time, there is no need to install your own copy just to use the software. 

TPEN requires tomcat 6, mysql, and an smtp server. TPEN will run under both linux and windows. Building TPEN from source requires apache ant. We have not tested installing it on Mac OS, but there is no reason why that should not work. 

0. Download the database extract from http://t-pen.org/tpensetup.sql . Create a database and user for TPEN, then import the database extract (ex. mysql --database=tpen_db_name --user=tpen_user --password=TPEN_password < tpen_extract.sql)
1. Download the source code and extract it. Also download the war file from http://t-pen.org/TPEN.war, which contains the needed libraries.
2. Make any modifications to the source code. If you want to use TPEN without modifying the source code, skip to step 5.
3. Edit src/java/version.properties setting the following:
	LOCALIMAGESTORE=(the complete path to where you want locally hosted images to be stored)
	DBUSER=(database user)
	DBPASSWORD=(database password)
	DATABASE=(database server url + database name, ex. localhost\:3306/TPEN)
	SERVERCONTEXT=(The URL where TPEN will be found, for internal image fetching ex. http\://localhost:8080/TPEN/)
	SERVERURL=(base server url ex. http\://localhost:8080/ )
	XSLTLOCATION=(location where schema.xsl, an XSLT for extracting the distinct tags from an xml document, is located ex. /TPEN/XSL/)
	uploadLocation=(location where image uploaded via TPEN should be stored. ex. /TPEN/images )
	maxUploadSize=(maximum size of an uploaded zip file of images, ex. 200000000)
	PalographyDataDir=(location where paleography feature data may be stored ex /TPEN/paleodata)
	imageCode=(A code used for internal image fetches. People who arent logged in cannot access images without this code.)
	TempPaleoResults=(location where temporary comparison results may be stored, ex /TPEN/paleoresults)
	NOTIFICATIONEMAIL=(email address all emails about new user signups, image loading errors, and the contact us form should go to)
	EMAILSERVER=(smtp relay ex. mailrelay.yourdomain.com)
4. Build the war file by running 'ant build' in the root directory for the TPEN source (where build.xml is located).
5. Copy the war file to (your tomcat install)/webapps
6. You can log in with the default user account admin//movies123
